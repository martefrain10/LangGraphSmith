        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
        "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
        "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
        "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
        "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
        "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

            "Agent Response: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique in machine learning that has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy. It reduces the number of trainable parameters in a neural network by introducing low-rank adapters to linear layers. LoRA is used for fine-tuning and full training of neural networks, resulting in faster training without sacrificing accuracy.\n",

            "Attention is a mechanism in machine learning that allows models to focus on specific parts of the input data when making predictions or decisions. It is commonly used in neural networks, especially in models like Transformers, to improve performance on tasks such as natural language processing and image recognition.\n"
